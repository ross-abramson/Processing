**Overview:** 

Two players are pitted against each other in a game of classic pong. The first player to reach the score limit wins. Every time a player scores, the ball and paddles are reset to their starting positions and a new game is played out. The respective scores are displayed in the top left and right corners of the screen. The center of the screen is the “net.” The ball itself gets faster and faster every time a player bounces it back to his opponent. 

**Controls:**

•	UP and DOWN arrow keys: Set score cap for players (limit is set at 20)
